📁 Project Title

Diabetes Analysis & Risk Insights Dashboard

📌 Project Description

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing diabetes-related health parameters to uncover trends, identify high-risk patient categories, and derive actionable insights.
The dashboard visually explores patterns in BMI, glucose levels, insulin values, age groups, skin thickness, and diabetes status, enabling better understanding of health risks and outcomes.

The project is designed for healthcare professionals, analysts, and students to evaluate how different health indicators influence diabetes outcomes.

❓ Key Questions Answered

This dashboard helps answer critical analytical questions such as:

Which age groups show the highest diabetes risk?
→ Peak risk observed in 51–60 age group.

What is the average BMI, glucose, and insulin level across the dataset?

How are risk levels distributed among patients?

Is there a relationship between BMI, glucose, and diabetes outcome?

How does skin thickness vary with glucose ranges for diabetic vs non-diabetic individuals?

Which factors contribute most to high-risk classification?
→ BMI, glucose levels, and age groups.

💼 Business Impact / Value

This dashboard can provide strong value to healthcare professionals and hospitals by:

✔ Early Risk Identification

Detects high-risk patients based on objective health metrics.

✔ Improved Preventive Care

Allows doctors and clinics to prioritize individuals showing early risk patterns.

✔ Data-Driven Decision Making

Supports clinical teams in understanding:

Which age groups need more screening

What physiological metrics show early symptoms

✔ Resource Optimization

Hospitals can allocate testing resources efficiently by focusing on diabetic-prone segments.

✔ Actionable Health Insights

Enables health researchers to track correlations between BMI, glucose, insulin, and diabetic outcomes.
